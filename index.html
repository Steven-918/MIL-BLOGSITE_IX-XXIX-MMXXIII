                <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc9">&quot; What was your perception of the media before this lesson? What is your view of media now? &quot;</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                The emergence of digital media has had a significant impact on traditional media channels like newspapers and television. More consumers today use online platforms, social media streaming services, and mobile applications to access news and entertainment. The manner in which media is created, disseminated, and consumed has changed as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
                I must admit that before this lecture, I didn't give the media much thought. It simply existed continuously, like background noise. I generally used it for enjoyment, keeping up with current events, and occasionally getting lost in the internet's collection of amusing cat videos. I didn't give any thought to how it would affect our culture or how it affects how we perceive things.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now that I've learned this lesson, I clearly see the media's influence and strength. I understand that it's not just about providing people with entertainment or information; it's also about influencing people's opinions, thoughts, and even emotions. It's important to use caution and discernment when consuming media because it can be utilized for both positive and evil purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also discovered that the media is a complicated ecology with a variety of sources, biases, and agendas rather than a single, monolithic corporation. Some media sources are more trustworthy than others, therefore it's crucial to look for different viewpoints to get a more complete picture of any problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, I no longer view the media as something I take for granted, but rather as a potent force that demands serious thought and study. Its potential impact on our lives and society at large has come to my attention.

            <h3>
                <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc9">&quot; What is the most relevant function of media to you? Why? &quot;</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                The public can be informed and educated by the media on a variety of subjects, such as politics, science, technology, health, culture, and more. People can make educated judgments and take part in democratic processes when they are knowledgeable about local, national, and international events. The ability of media to bring people together, share experiences, and start conversations is, in my opinion, its most important purpose. We congregate around it like a virtual campfire to share thoughts, stories, and feelings. Let me summarize it for you:
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="numbering">1.</span> <span class="misc7">Connection</span>: We can communicate with individuals from all over the world thanks to the media, which comes in many forms such as social media, television, and the internet. It allows us to see how others live, think, and feel while bridging geographic distances. Even though we have never met in person, it feels like we have pals all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">2.</span> <span class="misc7">Storytelling</span>: The modern day storyteller is the media. It presents stories that inform, entertain, and occasionally inspire us in order to help us understand the world better, whether through news articles, movies, or Instagram stories. It resembles an endless repository of human knowledge and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">3.</span> <span class="misc7">Conversation Starter</span>: The media gives us a platform for conversation. We start discussing when we read a provocative article or see a contentious documentary. We test our own beliefs, exchange ideas with others, and learn from them. It's comparable to the best icebreaker at a large party.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">4.</span> <span class="misc7">Reflection of Society</span>: Our beliefs, fears, and goals as a society are reflected in the media. It serves as a mirror to our culture, illuminating the things we value, decry, and need to improve. It functions as a feedback loop to keep us developing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">5.</span> <span class="misc7">Empowerment</span>: The media gives people and groups a voice. People can express themselves, promote causes, and affect change through blogging, vlogging, or even TikTok dances. It's similar to giving anyone with a message the megaphone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">6.</span> <span class="misc7">Entertainment</span>: Let's not forget the fun part! Media entertains us, allowing us to escape from our daily routines, laugh, cry, and be amazed. It's like a magical portal to other worlds, right at our fingertips.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in easy way to say, the most relevant function of media to me is its ability to connect us, tell our stories, start conversations, reflect our society, empower individuals, and provide endless entertainment. It's like a vibrant tapestry of human experiences that enriches our lives in countless ways.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc9">&quot; Recall a recent situation wherein media and information literacy could have been useful and how as. &quot;</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A vital skill is media and information literacy. It describes the capacity to access, assess, and evaluate numerous media and information sources. Understanding how the media operates, being able to assess the reliability and veracity of sources, and using information responsibly are all part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently came across this pretty surprising headline while reading through my social media page. I'm a bit of a science fiction buff, so my initial reaction was enthusiasm, like, "Wow, this is amazing!" But then, I thought, "Hold on a second, is this for real?" It read something like, "Aliens have landed on Earth, and they're taking over!"
            </p>
            <p>
                I then understood how extremely helpful media and information literacy could have been. I made the choice to do a little more research before I instantly shared the headline with all of my friends after believing it. I opened the article by clicking on it. It turned out that the article had no reliable sources or quotes from experts and had been put on a website that I had never heard of. The more I thought about it, the more it appeared to be a clickbait headline created to attract attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, if I hadn't been media literate, I might have fallen for it and started spreading the news like wildfire. But because I had a basic understanding of media literacy, I decided not to share it and waited for more reliable sources to confirm or deny the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "alien invasion" incident turned proved to be a hoax, and no reliable news sources covered it. We obviously want to prevent the spread of false information, so if I had shared it out of the blue, I might have contributed to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, media and information literacy came to my rescue in this case by enabling me to examine the material I found critically and come to a more informed conclusion about whether or not to believe it and spread it. In our era of fake news and digital information overload, it's a skill that's growing more and more crucial, therefore we should all work to master it.

            <h3>
                <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc2">&quot; Analyze how the same product is presented through different media. Which one is more effective for you? Why?  &quot;</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                When information is given across various media, it's critical to take into account a number of factors, including the target audience, the message being sent, and the overall impact of each medium. Why? I personally believe that a mix of interactive and visual media is more potent. I become interested in a product when it is advertised with visually attractive graphics or videos. Interactive components like virtual tours or product devils, which are incredibly compelling, enable a greater level of contact with the product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sure, let's get started on this! Consider that we are discussing a cutting-edge smartphone, which is a really cool gadget. Let's now examine how it is portrayed in two different mediums: a TV commercial and a social media advertisement.
            </p>
            <p>
                TV Commercial:
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine yourself watching your favorite TV show while lounging on your comfortable couch and snacking on some munchies. A dazzling smartphone advertisement appears out of nowhere. The commercial has beautiful images of individuals utilizing phones in various interesting situations. It displays the phone's svelte appearance, excellent camera, and lightning-quick speed. The narrator, which highlights the phone's amazing capabilities, is enthusiastic and the background music is catchy. You also see some endorsements from famous people. Overall, the exhilaration lasts about 30 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social Media Ad:
            </p>
            <p>
                As you go through your preferred social media platform right now, an advertisement for the same smartphone pops up. It's a video, but you can swipe past it or decide to view it. The opening scene of the video features a close-up of the phone's camera, showcasing its remarkable photographic powers. Short videos of people using their phones for commonplace activities, such taking pictures of their food, watching movies, and conversing with pals, are then shown. The wording for the advertisement uses emojis to refer to the phone as "the ultimate sidekick for your adventures."
            </p>
            <p>
                Which one is more effective for me?
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I find the social media ad more effective. Here's why:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">1.</span> <span class="misc7">Relevance</span>: You are more likely to see things you might be interested in seeing in social media ads because they are frequently customized to your interests and online activity. In this instance, I'm more likely to interact with the advertisement because I'm already going through my social network feed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">2.</span> <span class="misc7">Engagement</span>: I have control since I can decide whether to view the video or not. I have the option to interact with the advertisement when I feel like it or to swipe past it when I don't. On the other side, I dislike how TV ads cut into my show.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">3.</span> <span class="misc7">Informal and Relatable</span>: The use of emojis and informal language in the message makes the social media advertisement seem more approachable and real. It seems to be speaking specifically about me and my way of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">4.</span> <span class="misc7">Product Showcase</span>: The social media ad emphasizes practical uses of the gadget, such as shooting images of food and conversing with friends, rather than the flash and glamour of the TV advertisement. I can relate to this because it demonstrates how my phone may integrate into my daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">5.</span> <span class="misc7">Peer Influence</span>: My judgment may be favourably influenced if the advertisement contains user-generated content or feedback from users who have previously purchased the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the personalized, interesting, personable, and lifestyle-appropriate nature of the social media commercial makes it feel more effective in my eyes. It allows me to make a decision without interfering with my experience, which makes it a more enjoyable and efficient approach to learn about the product.
            </p>

                <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc2">&quot; What is the impact of using such platforms to advertise one's business or in any other endeavor?  &quot;</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Both visibility and range. Platforms like social media, search engines, websites, and mobile apps can reach a large audience. By utilizing these media, businesses may increase their visibility and reach more potential customers. Similar to how a superhero's capabilities can change their world, using platforms to promote your company or pursue other goals can have a significant impact. Let's deconstruct it:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">1.</span> <span class="misc7">Visibility and Reach</span>: Imagine you're throwing a big party, but it's hidden in a secret cave. No one will know about it, right? Well, advertising on platforms like social media, search engines, or websites is like sending out magical invitations to everyone. More people can learn about your business or project.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">2.</span> <span class="misc7">Connection and Engagement</span>: Think of these platforms as a big party where you get to chat with your guests. You can respond to their comments, answer questions, and get to know them better. This engagement helps build relationships, just like making friends at a real party.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">3.</span> <span class="misc7">Cost-Effective</span>: Back in the old days, traditional advertising could be expensive, like renting a big billboard. But on platforms, you can start with a small budget, like a pocketful of coins, and still get results. It's like being able to make magic happen without emptying your wallet.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                <span class="numbering">5.</span> <span class="misc7">Data and Analytics</span>: These platforms are like wizards who give you a crystal ball to see what's working and what's not. You can track things like how many people saw your ad, clicked on it, or even made a purchase. It's like having a map to navigate your journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">6.</span> <span class="misc7">24/7 Availability</span>: Your business can be like a magical shop that's open all the time, even when you're sleeping or on vacation. People can learn about you and make purchases at any hour of the day.

            <p>
                <span class="numbering">7.</span> <span class="misc7">Competition and Innovation</span>: Other businesses are also using these platforms, so it's like a friendly magic duel. You can see what others are doing and come up with new tricks and ideas to stand out.

                But, just like any magic, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There can be some challenges too:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span class="numbering">1.</span> <span class="misc7">Competition</span>: Since everyone's trying to use these platforms, it can get crowded. So, standing out can be a bit tricky, like trying to be the most eye-catching magician at a magician convention.

            <p>
                <span class="numbering">3.</span> <span class="misc7">Budget Management</span>: You need to be careful with your budget, or you might end up spending too much, like a wizard who uses up all their magic potions too quickly.

                <span class="numbering">4.</span> <span class="misc7">Privacy Concerns</span>: Some people are concerned about their data being collected by these platforms, so you need to be respectful of their privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, using these platforms can be like having a magical wand to boost your business or project. But like any superhero, you need to use your powers wisely and responsibly to have a positive impact on the world.

            </h3>
            <p>
                A vital skill is media and information literacy. It describes the capacity to access, assess, and evaluate numerous media and information sources. Understanding how the media operates, being able to assess the reliability and veracity of sources, and using information responsibly are all part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before this lesson, I didn't really give the media much thought. I mean, I consumed news and entertainment through various outlets like TV, social media, and websites, but I didn't pay much attention to how it all worked or the impact it had on society. It was just something that was always there in the background of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now, after this lesson, I have a whole new perspective on the media. I've come to realize that it's not just about reporting facts and stories. It's a powerful force that shapes our opinions, beliefs, and even our behavior. It can be a tool for enlightenment and education, but it can also be used to manipulate and deceive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've learned that the media isn't just one monolithic entity; it's made up of various outlets, each with its own agenda and biases. It's not always easy to discern what's true and what's not, and I've become more aware of the importance of critical thinking and media literacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, I now see that the media plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable. It can be a voice for the marginalized and a watchdog for democracy. But it can also be a source of division and sensationalism if not handled responsibly.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, my view of the media has shifted from something I took for granted to something I now see as a complex and influential part of our society. I feel a greater responsibility to be a discerning consumer of media and to support journalism that strives for accuracy, fairness, and transparency.

                Rappler, the renowned digital news platform and a prominent figure in the Philippines' media landscape, has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to defending and advancing ideals that are not only pivotal for society but also integral to the principles of journalism. This commitment extends to collaborating with various financing organizations to champion causes that resonate deeply with a broad spectrum of individuals and communities. Key among these ideals are freedom, environmental preservation, and human rights, which have become critical touchstones in the modern era.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the standout moments in Rappler's history that exemplifies its dedication to safeguarding fundamental freedoms occurred in 2016 when it played a pivotal role in ensuring the preservation of press freedom in the Philippines. When the Commission on Elections sought to limit internet media access to the presidential and vice-presidential debates, Rappler emerged as a staunch advocate for an open and free press. Their unwavering commitment to this cause led them to successfully argue their case before the Philippines Supreme Court. This landmark victory not only solidified Rappler's reputation as a defender of the free press but also sent a powerful message about the importance of open dialogue and the dissemination of information in a democratic society.

            <p>
                <span class="misc10">SETTING</span> &dash; The documentary unfolds in the vibrant city of Taguig and various other cities scattered across the sprawling metropolis of Manila.

            <p>
                <span class="misc10">MISE-EN-SCÈNE</span> &dash; The visual storytelling of this documentary is a masterful composition, capturing scenes from diverse locales along the Pasig River. It employs a spectrum of camera angles, including low, high, tilted, and neutral perspectives, creating a dynamic visual narrative that immerses the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="misc10">ACTING</span> &dash; The central figure in this documentary is a person of remarkable determination. Their voice resonates with a calm, almost meditative quality, while their distinctive mannerisms, such as fiddling with a necklace and the contemplative act of puffing on a cigarette, set them apart from the norm.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="misc10">COLOR</span> &dash; The use of color in this documentary serves as a powerful tool for evoking mood and ambiance. However, the color scheme deliberately appears subdued and shadowy to effectively convey the harsh realities faced by these children. It casts a poignant light on their experiences, emphasizing the more somber aspects of their lives.

            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="misc10">EDITING</span> &dash; Employing the "eye trace" technique as a storytelling tool, the documentary seamlessly wove together various settings, captivating the viewer's attention through continuity editing. This approach ensured a smooth and engaging narrative flow, allowing the audience to effortlessly follow the storyline.

            <p>
                <span class="misc10">AUDIO</span> &dash; Within this documentary, Foley sounds took center stage, strategically integrated to enhance the existing sound design. Foley sound effects were meticulously crafted to replicate real-life sounds using props and other elements, adding layers of realism to each scene. This auditory craftsmanship aimed to immerse the audience more deeply into the storytelling experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="misc10">LIGHTING</span> &dash; The documentary employed a deliberate choice of low and gloomy lighting to artistically mirror the lives of its subjects. This evocative use of lighting served as a visual metaphor, emphasizing the hardships and challenges faced by those whose stories were being told, while also creating a distinctive and impactful atmosphere that resonated throughout the film.
